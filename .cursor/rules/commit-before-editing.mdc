# Commit Before Modifying or Generating Code

Before making any modifications or generating new code, ensure that all current changes are committed to version control. This helps maintain a clean project history and makes it easier to track new changes.

**Workflow:**
1. Review your working directory for uncommitted changes.
2. Stage and commit all changes with a descriptive message.
3. Proceed with code modifications or generation only after confirming a clean working state.

This rule applies to all contributors and automated tools.
